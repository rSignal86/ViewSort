# Changelog
## [GHv2.0] – 2025-04-18

### Added
- **PDF Export Functionality**  
  Added a "Generate PDF" button to export the sorted callsign list using `jsPDF`.  
  This allows users to download a clean, formatted version of their QSL sorting results.

- **Structured Prefix Configuration (`prefixData`)**  
  Introduced a structured JSON-style data object to manage country prefixes, QSL sorting availability, related territories, and special sorting rules.

- **Country-specific Metadata**  
  Added extensive metadata for over 100 countries including:
  - Display ranges
  - Special sorting rules (e.g., USA, Japan, Australia, Canada)
  - Territories and dependencies
  - QSL support status (enabled/disabled)

### Changed
- **DOM Structure & IDs Renamed**
  - `#callsign-list` ➡ `#callsign-list-input`
  - `#sorted-output` ➡ `#callsign-sorted-list-output`
  - Added `#generate-pdf-button` (hidden by default until sorting is triggered)

- **Validation & Debug Logging**
  - Added verification for essential DOM elements on load.
  - Errors are logged to console for missing or misnamed elements.
  - Early error handling to help during development.

### Improved
- **Prefix Validation Logic**
  - More accurate matching against known valid and excluded prefixes.
  - Better distinction between "excluded", "no national QSL service", and "unknown" prefixes.

- **Scalability**
  - New structure enables easier updates to prefix data, e.g., by fetching JSON from an API or remote source in the future.

### Removed
- Hardcoded `validPrefixes`, `excludedPrefixes`, and `noNationalQSLSortService` arrays in favor of the dynamic `prefixData` model.
