## ViewSort is a simple yet intelligent web tool built to help amateur radio operators efficiently sort their QSL cards before mailing them.  
It validates, organizes, and flags callsigns according to common QSL bureau rules. If you don't know how to sort QSL cards, ViewSort will do it for you.  
All you have to do is write the callsign into the program and note the number it gives you back on the card.  
When you're done, click "Start Sorting" and follow the numbers from top to bottom. The program will also tell you which cards require more attention.

> üéâ **New "thing":** You can now generate a **PDF** with the sorted results ‚Äì perfect for printing or archiving.

No installation required. Simply clone or download the repository and open the `ViewSort.html` file in your browser.
It is recommended to place ViewSort.html on your desktop.

Built with ‚ù§Ô∏è by an amateur for an amateur, with help from AI.
