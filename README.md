# People with disabilities
I am very keen that everyone should benefit from this program, so I try to make it accessible to people with visual and hearing impairments. 
I have included buttons that users can click to have certain values â€‹â€‹read out to you. There are functions in the browser that allow you to make text to speech work with a synthetic voice, this is done with the "Web Speech API"

# Built With
- HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript
- Web Speech API (for voice assistance)
- AI-assisted development tools

# Versions note:
GHv1.0: Fully working prototype

# Version number interpretation
The first number is determined by three numbers the first number is a major version update the second number is say minor update like adding a small function and the last number indicates that it is a bug fixed to the small function. A good example is version 2.5.1 which is a bug fix for version 2.5
